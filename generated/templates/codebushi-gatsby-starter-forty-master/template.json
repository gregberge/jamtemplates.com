Check out https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters-and-themes/ for more Gatsby starters and templates.\n\n## Preview\n\nhttps://gatsby-forty.surge.sh\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:\n<br/>\n`gatsby new gatsby-starter-forty https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-forty`\n\nRun `gatsby develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.\n\n## CSS Grid\n\nThe grid on this site was replaced with a custom version, built using CSS Grid. It's a very simple 12 column grid that is disabled on mobile. To start using the grid, wrap the desired items with `grid-wrapper`. Items inside the `grid-wrapper` use the class `col-` followed by a number, which should add up to 12.\n\nHere is an example of using the grid, for a 3 column layout:\n\n```\n<div className=\"grid-wrapper\">\n    <div className=\"col-4\">\n        <p>Content Here</p>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"col-4\">\n        <p>Content Here</p>\n    </div>\n    <div className=\"col-4\">\n        <p>Content Here</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n"},"demoUrl":"https://gatsby-forty.surge.sh/","repoUrl":"https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-forty","starsCount":203,"forksCount":94,"openIssuesCount":3,"lastCommitDate":"2021-01-16T08:34:26Z","createdAt":"2017-12-02T23:10:35Z"}
