See Gatsby's [Development Environment Setup](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/) documentation for more details or issues with initial project installation.\n\n1. **Install Project**\n\n    Create new site using `gastby new` command. This command will also install the project dependencies.\n\n\n    ```bash\n    gatsby new gatsby-minimal-portfolio https://github.com/BrianRuizy/gatsby-minimal-portfolio\n    ```\n\n2. **Start Developing**\n\n\n    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up using `gatsby develop` command.\n\n    ```bash\n    gatsby develop\n\n    DONE - Compiled successful\n    You can now view Brian-Ruiz-Portfolio in the browser.\n    http://localhost:8000/\n    ```\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing this portfolio website and adding your own content is super simple! Add your respective project markdown-file to the `_data` folder, and Gatsby + GraphQL + Remark does the rest of the work rendering the markdown file to html. Same applies for site metadata, add your own content to `site-meta-data.json`.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23439187/113368846-568baf00-9325-11eb-8212-33f8473e9236.png)\nSee [_data/readme.md](https://github.com/BrianRuizy/gatsby-minimal-portfolio/blob/master/_data/readme.md) for examples on .md syntax, or [brianruizy.com/markdown-help/](https://brianruizy/markdown-help).\n\n## Deployment\n\n[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start)\n\nNetlify currently has built in support for GitHub. You gain the ability to redeploy the site by pushing the code to the respective repository, with no need to manually rebuild and upload every time you make changes. See Gatsby's [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-netlify/) for more detail.\n\n1. Login to Netlify.com and you will see a `New site from git` button at the top right corner of the screen. Click on it and connect with the same git provider that you used to host your website and authorize Netlify to use your account.\n\n2. Choose your `website repository` and it will take you to deploy settings with the below options.\n\n     - Branch to deploy: You can specify a branch to monitor. When you push to that particular branch, only then will Netlify build and deploy the site. The default is master.\n     - Build Command: You can specify the command you want Netlify to run when you push to the above branch. The default is npm run build.\n\n3. Click on the `Deploy site` button and Netlify will start the build and deploy process you have specified. You can go to the `Deploys` tab and see the process unfold in the Deploy log. After a few moments, it will give you the live site URL, e.g., random-name.netlify.com.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis site's Web design was made possible thanks to these awesome packages / plugins!\n\n| Function | Package + Link |\n| ------------- | ---------- |\n| UI Library | [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) |\n| Dark Mode | [gatsby-plugin-dark-mode](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode/) |\n| Syntax Highlighting | [gatsby-remark-prismjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-prismjs/?=prismjs) |\n| UI element(s) | [react-bottom-drawer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bottom-drawer) |\n| Icons | [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) |\n| Fonts | [google-fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [rfs](https://github.com/twbs/rfs) |\n"},"demoUrl":"https://www.brianruizy.com","repoUrl":"https://github.com/BrianRuizy/gatsby-minimal-portfolio","starsCount":15,"forksCount":4,"openIssuesCount":2,"lastCommitDate":"2021-04-10T16:38:12Z","createdAt":"2019-04-09T01:11:46Z"}
