{"id":"gatsbycentral-gatsby-starter-wordpress-master","title":"Gatsby Wordpress","description":"A Gatsby template that leverages the WordPress API, ACF and more.","author":"Gatsby Central","ssg":["Gatsby"],"cms":["Wordpress"],"gatsby":{"version":2,"type":"starter"},"license":"MIT","github":{"branch":"master","owner":"GatsbyCentral","repo":"gatsby-starter-wordpress","readmeContent":"# Gatsby v2 WordPress Starter\n\nThis starter is forked from the\n[gatsby-starter-netlify-cms](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)\nand modified to use WordPress instead of netlify-cms, using the [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress) plugin as the data connector.\n\nDemo: https://gatsby-starter-wordpress.netlify.com/\n\n## Use It Now\n\n    gatsby new NAME https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress\n\n* Edit `gatsby-config.js`, change `baseUrl`\n  - Make sure you have at least 1 post and 1 page on your WordPress site\n  - Make sure at least 1 post has at least 1 tag\n* Ensure the permalink structure in your WordPress installation is set to `Post Name` instead of the deafult `Plain`, or else the `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin won't be able to communicate with WordPress\n* Rejoice\n  - For more information on the source plugin, check out the [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress) repository page\n  - File any [issues here](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/issues)\n\n### Known Limitations\n\n* This is based on the [netlify starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) which uses [bulma](https://bulma.io). This adds 150KB to every built page.\n* Your WordPress site must have at least 1 post with 1 tag, or the starter will crash\n* Nested pages / categories will not render with nested pages\n  - A WordPress page like `/about/team/` will render on Gatsby as `/team/`\n  - Likewise for categories\n  - Discussion here https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-starter-wordpress/issues/24\n\n## CSS Processing\n\nThis plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma build would otherwise be ~170K which adds 170K to each of your built HTML pages. However, with purgecss this is reduced 90%.\n\n## WordPress Setup\n\nCheck the [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress) plugin for more information. If you want to copy the demo content, you can grab the [WordPress XML export here](https://wpdemo.gatsbycentral.com/gatsbystarterwordpress.WordPress.2019-09-12.xml) and import it into your WordPress site as a starting point.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease post support questions on StackOverflow or other similar sites. Please only post issues here if you have a bug to report with a reproduction. Unfortunately we're not able to provide support here.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis starter was forked from the netlify starter by the\n[GatsbyCentral](https://www.gatsbycentral.com/) crew.
