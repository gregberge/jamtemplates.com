Create a super fast, beautiful landing page from a barebones template with a single page that already looks good.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIf you do not have the Gatsby CLI installed yet, do it first.\n\n```bash\nnpm install --global gatsby-cli\n```\n\nThe Gatsby CLI uses Node and npm which you will also need installed. More information can be found on [GatsbyJS.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/).\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\nInstall the starter using the Gatsby new command.\n\n```bash\ngatsby new landing-page https://github.com/gillkyle/gatsby-starter-landing-page.git\n```\n\nNavigate into the project directory and launch the site.\n\n```bash\ncd landing-page && gatsby develop\n```\n\nThe site will be opened up in your default browser on http://localhost:8000\n\nEdit code in the `/src`, save your changes, and they'll reload instantly in the browser.\n\n## 🧐 What's inside?\n\nThe minimal landing page starter comes with a few plugins installed already, but it's main focus is on staying simple and looking clean. These things are included by default:\n\n- 🖼 Gatsby Image: images added to the `src/images` folder are automatically optimized by the `gatsby-image` plugin and can be pulled into components with lazy loading and blur up effects\n- 📊 Analytics: add your Google Analytics tracking id to `gatsby-config.js` to automatically begin tracking visitors to the site\n- 🗺 Sitemap: any new pages added to the site are automically assembled together into a sitemap through `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`\n- 🎨 Color Theme: the `src/styles/constants.js` file contains a set of colors and default styles that are applied inline to components on the site that can be overriden with your own styles\n\n## 🧪 Experiment\n\nIf you want to try playing with the source code in an online playground you can open the repo in Codesandox with this button.\n\n[![Edit gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/gillkyle/gatsby-starter-landing-page/tree/master/)\n\n## 💫 Deploy\n\nIf you just want to see a site online real fast you can deploy a copy of the site to Netlify with this button.\n\n[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gillkyle/gatsby-starter-landing-page)\n\nTo create an optimized build of the site run this command\n\n```bash\ngatsby build\n```\n\nA `/public` folder will be assembled that can be deployed to a service like Netlify, Surge, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, Firebase hosting, or your own file server.\n"},"demoUrl":"https://gatsby-starter-landing-page.netlify.com/","repoUrl":"https://github.com/gillkyle/gatsby-starter-landing-page","starsCount":103,"forksCount":26,"openIssuesCount":11,"lastCommitDate":"2021-01-02T18:28:21Z","createdAt":"2019-03-19T18:05:37Z"}
