Includes adaptive image grids powered by CSS grid and automatic image integration into projects. Using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-jodie`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-jodie).\n\n[**Demo Website**](https://jodie.lekoarts.de)\n\nAlso be sure to checkout other [Free & Open Source Gatsby Themes](https://themes.lekoarts.de)\n\n## ‚ú® Features\n\n- MDX\n- Fully customizable through the usage of Gatsby Themes (and Theme UI)\n- Create a project by creating an MDX file and dropping the images into the same folder\n- Extensible custom pages\n- Define colors for each page and the sidebar & content will adapt while maintaining WCAG 2 AA contrast ratios\n- Google Analytics Support\n- SEO (Sitemap, OpenGraph tags, Twitter tags)\n- Offline Support & WebApp Manifest\n\n## üöÄ Getting Started\n\n1. **Create a Gatsby site.**\n\nUse the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying this project\n\n```sh\ngatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-jodie\n```\n\n2. **Start developing.**\n\nNavigate into your new site's directory and start it up.\n\n```sh\ncd project-name\ngatsby develop\n```\n\n3. **Open the code and start customizing!**\n\nYour site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!\n\nIf you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can checkout this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.\n\n## üìù Using and modifying this starter\n\n**Important Note:** Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the underlying theme!\n\nThis starter creates a new Gatsby site that installs and configures the theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-jodie`](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-jodie).\n\nHave a look at the theme's README and files to see what options are available and how you can shadow the various components including Theme UI. Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-jodie/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.\n\n### Change your `static` folder\n\nThe `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and robots.txt. Don't forget to change these files, too!\n\n## ü§î Questions or problems?\n\nPlease open up an issue on the main repository: [LekoArts/gatsby-themes](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes). Thanks!\n\n## üéì Learning Gatsby\n\nLooking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).\n\n### Themes\n\n- To learn more about Gatsby themes specifically, we recommend checking out the [theme docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/).\n\n### General\n\n- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.\n\n- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Reference Guides_ and _Gatsby API_ sections in the sidebar.\n\n## üåü Supporting me\n\nThanks for using this project!
